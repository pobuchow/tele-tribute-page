                <p>The Fender Telecaster, colloquially known as the Tele, 
                    is the world's first commercially successful solid-body electric guitar. 
                    Its simple yet effective design and revolutionary sound broke ground 
                    and set trends in electric guitar manufacturing and popular music.</p>

                        The initial single-pickup production model appeared in 1950, 
                        and was called the Fender Esquire.
                        Ash and maple were used to construct the body and neck respectively and the guitar came in one color - blond. 
                        Fewer than fifty guitars were originally produced under that name, and most were replaced under warranty because of early manufacturing problems. 
                        In particular, the Esquire necks had no truss rod and many were replaced due to bent necks. 
                        Later in 1950, this single-pickup model was discontinued, and a two-pickup model was renamed the Broadcaster. 
                        From this point onward all Fender necks incorporated truss rods. 
                        The Esquire was reintroduced in 1951 as a single pickup variant, at a lower price.

                        As a result of legal action from the Gretsch company over the guitar's name, 
                        the Broadcaster (Gretsch already had the "Broadkaster" name registered for a line of drums), 
                        factory workers simply snipped the "Broadcaster" name from its existing stock of decals, 
                        so guitars with these decals are identified simply as "Fender", without any model name.
                        The term Nocaster was later coined by collectors to denote these transitional guitars 
                        that appeared without a model name on the headstock. 
                        Since they were manufactured in this form for 8-9 months in 1951,
                        original Nocasters are highly prized by collectors. 
                        There are no official production numbers, but experts estimate that fewer than 500 Nocasters were produced. 
                        Fender has since registered Nocaster as a trademark to denote its modern replicas of this famous rarity.
                        In around September 1951, Fender renamed the guitar to Telecaster and started placing these decals on the headstock. 
                        The guitar now known as the Fender Telecaster was born.
                        With a transparent butterscotch finish, single ply 'Black Guard', 
                        Maple neck with Walnut back stripe, the Telecaster was set to become 
                        the most successfully mass produced electric guitar in history along with the Fender Stratocaster arriving in 1954.

                        Now that Leo Fender was clear of any patent or naming infringements, 
                        by 1952, the Fender company began producing the Telecaster guitar in larger numbers. 
                        These early Telecasters would become known as Blackguards produced between 1950-1954.
                        For further reading, 
                        Nacho Banos wrote an excellent book concerning these particular Telecaster guitars in 2005 called "The Blackguard : 
                        A Detailed History of the Early Fender Telecaster Years 1950-1954".
