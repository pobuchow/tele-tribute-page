            The Fender Telecaster, colloquially known as the Tele, is the
            world's first commercially successful solid-body electric guitar.
            Its simple yet effective design and revolutionary sound broke ground
            and set trends in electric guitar manufacturing and popular music.

              The initial single-pickup production model appeared in 1950, and
              was called the Fender Esquire. Ash and maple were used to
              construct the body and neck respectively and the guitar came in
              one color - blond. Fewer than fifty guitars were originally
              produced under that name, and most were replaced under warranty
              because of early manufacturing problems. In particular, the
              Esquire necks had no truss rod and many were replaced due to bent
              necks. Later in 1950, this single-pickup model was discontinued,
              and a two-pickup model was renamed the Broadcaster. From this
              point onward all Fender necks incorporated truss rods. The Esquire
              was reintroduced in 1951 as a single pickup variant, at a lower
              price.

            <h2>
                1951
              </h2>
              <p>
                As a result of legal action from the Gretsch company over the
                guitar's name, the Broadcaster (Gretsch already had the
                "Broadkaster" name registered for a line of drums), factory
                workers simply snipped the "Broadcaster" name from its existing
                stock of decals, so guitars with these decals are identified
                simply as "Fender", without any model name. The term Nocaster was
                later coined by collectors to denote these transitional guitars
                that appeared without a model name on the headstock. Since they
                were manufactured in this form for 8-9 months in 1951, original
                Nocasters are highly prized by collectors. There are no official
                production numbers, but experts estimate that fewer than 500
                Nocasters were produced. Fender has since registered Nocaster as a
                trademark to denote its modern replicas of this famous rarity. In
                around September 1951, Fender renamed the guitar to Telecaster and
                started placing these decals on the headstock. The guitar now
                known as the Fender Telecaster was born. With a transparent
                butterscotch finish, single ply 'Black Guard', Maple neck with
                Walnut back stripe, the Telecaster was set to become the most
                successfully mass produced electric guitar in history along with
                the Fender Stratocaster arriving in 1954.

                1952
              </h2>
              <p>
                Now that Leo Fender was clear of any patent or naming
                infringements, by 1952, the Fender company began producing the
                Telecaster guitar in larger numbers. These early Telecasters would
                become known as Blackguards produced between 1950-1954. For
                further reading, Nacho Banos wrote an excellent book concerning
                these particular Telecaster guitars in 2005 called "The Blackguard
                : A Detailed History of the Early Fender Telecaster Years
                1950-1954".

              <p>
                Leroy "Roy" Buchanan (September 23, 1939 – August 14, 1988) was
                an American guitarist and blues musician. A pioneer of the
                Telecaster sound, Buchanan worked as a sideman and as a solo
                artist, with two gold albums early in his career and two later
                solo albums that made it to the Billboard chart. He never
                achieved stardom, but he is still considered a highly
                influential guitar player. Guitar Player praised him as having
                one of the "50 Greatest Tones of All Time."
